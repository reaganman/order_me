$$$Going through your files I would like to see more doc strings. I think it would be helpful for them to describe the types of files that are being inputted and outputted. Also a brief overview of what the files do. The comments are helpful and I would keep those, but have a broad description in the doc string. Also, here in the readme I think it would be helpful to have a schematic that shows the progression of the files or maybe a short paragraph that describes something along the lines of "you start with file A then pass it through codeA and get file B, then yuo take file B and... etc". --Erin $$$
