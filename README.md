# Introduction
a specific frog species has an enzyme that acts like an antifreeze allowing it to survive through below freezing tempoeratures when it's hibernating. We will compare the responsible gene to similar genes in other species to better understand it.

$$$Going through your files I would like to see more doc strings. I think it would be helpful for them to describe the types of files that are being inputted and outputted. Also a brief overview of what the files do. The comments are helpful and I would keep those, but have a broad description in the doc string. Also, here in the readme I think it would be helpful to have a schematic that shows the progression of the files or maybe a short paragraph that describes something along the lines of "you start with file A then pass it through codeA and get file B, then yuo take file B and... etc". --Erin $$$
